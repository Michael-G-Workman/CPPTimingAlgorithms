Example C++ program for timing of algorithms. This example application will time the difference
between sorting a vector of consecutive integer numbers, compare to sorting a vector of shuffled
integer numbers. The vector sort method should be able to sort the consecutive vector much
faster than sorting a shuffled vector.
